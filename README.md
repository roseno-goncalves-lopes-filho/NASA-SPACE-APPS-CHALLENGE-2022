### “Sun Tracker: an artificial intelligence algorithm that predicts Carrington-like events”


In 1859, a massive cloud of electrified gas and highly charged subatomic  particles  struck  the  Earth's  magnetosphere,  causing  damage  to the world's telegraph networks. Caused by a violent coronal mass ejection (CME),  the  Carrington  Event  was  the  largest  geomagnetic  storm  ever recorded. If a similar event were to occur today, however, the consequences would  be  economically  and  socially  devastating,  given  society's high dependence on electricity and power lines compared to the time of the event. Therefore, to create a tool to  help predict similar solar storms, in this  work  we  have  developed  an  artificial  intelligence  algorithm  capable  of predicting Carrington-like events based on the speed of nonlinear protons originating  from  phenomena  related  to  the  Sun's  magnetic  activity. The "Sun Tracker", a name given to the algorithm by the authors, was developed using  a  Decision  Tree  machine  learning  model,  which  used  databases from the DSCOVR and WIND space missions for the training and test sets. The Sun Tracker achieved 79.5% accuracy, evidencing the model's effectiveness in  predicting  solar  events  of  risk  to  terrestrial  electrical  and  electronic infrastructure.
